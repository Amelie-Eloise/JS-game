## Ashurbanipal's game

The British Museum [I am Asurbanipal, King of the World](https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/ashurbanipal.aspx) includes the board for a game the king played. The rules he used aren't known with certainty, but this is a JavaScript game to create a possible version, based on later versions of the game but simplified to make sense with the board from the exhibition.

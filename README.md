# JS-game

# The original brief:
# JavaScript coding competition for HTML5 Game Developers. The fun part of the compo is the file size limit set to 13 kilobytes. 
# All your code and game assets should be smaller than or equal to 13 kilobytes (13,312 bytes, because of 13 x 1024) when zipped. 
# Your .zip package should contain index.html file and when unzipped should work in the browser.

## JavaScript game challenge

The original brief:
'JavaScript coding competition for HTML5 Game Developers. The fun part of the compo is the file size limit set to 13 kilobytes. 
All your code and game assets should be smaller than or equal to 13 kilobytes (13,312 bytes, because of 13 x 1024) when zipped. 
Your .zip package should contain index.html file and when unzipped should work in the browser.'

## Ashurbanipal's game

The British Museum's 'I am Asurbanipal, King of the World' exhibition included the board for a game the king played, the 'Game of 58 holes'. The orignal rules are lost, so this is a JavaScript version based on a mix of R. C. Bell's and Dmitriy Skiryuk's reconstructions.
